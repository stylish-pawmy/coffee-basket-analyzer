    "The **Apriori** algorithm is one of the most widely used techniques for association rule learning in data mining. It follows a bottom-up approach, beginning with individual items (1-itemsets) and progressively combining them to form larger sets, a process known as candidate generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step, the algorithm evaluates the candidate based on predefined thresholds for support, confidence, and lift. Only itemsets meeting these minimum requirements are retained for further exploration and inclusion in the final set of rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apriori employs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) strategy, systematically exploring all possible itemsets of size k before moving to k + 1. It leverages the **downward closure** property, which states that an itemset is considered frequent only if **all its subsets are frequent**. The algorithm terminates when no new candidate itemsets can be generated or none meet the threshold criteria."
